 Final Project Prep - GUI Wireframe
This semester you'll be building Java projects with graphical user interfaces (or better known as GUIs). What do you want to build?! It's time to commit now! The purpose of this unit deliverable is to help you start planning your final project. Most likely your design will change when you're building the project near the end of the semester, but your goal is to plan as much of the project as you can with as much detail as possible! The more the better!

Here is what you should do your UD2:

Design the wireframe of the GUI for your final project. Nothing fancy, you can use tools like Diagrams.netLinks to an external site. (requires Google account), Wireframe.ccLinks to an external site. (click X to use, but any saving requires free account), or any drawing program that's free or available to you! Pen/paper works too, just make sure its clean and readable when you scan it.
You can always add more later, but start conservative with your design but be thorough about what is useful for your application
Build the Java GUI in Intellij. You'll only need to build the front-end, meaning not every button/dropdown box/etc. has to do what it's supposed to
Layout all the components you'll need and start setting up the event handlers (even if all they do is print "hello" to the console, you just want to get it ready for whatever your full application will do)
Integrate your model class from UD1 into the GUI project
Recommend doing this in a way that is useful. For example, using the users data from the text fields to create the model class object when a button is clicked. This way, this UD is chipping away at your final project.
Again, doesn't have to have all the features you want for your final project, but this can be your first "proof of concept" that you're building towards the final project.
You're mostly coding the front-end of your project here. It may not have all the bells and whistles, but in Unit 3 you'll be building the final project that connects everything from this semester needed to accomplish what you want!

Tip: your UML from UD1 may have more classes that you require to get your project going. If you have the time now (remember, end of semester gets hectic!) you can start building some of those necessary parts that could help with integrating into the GUI as well!

 Submission Instructions
UD2 build off of UD1 do use that repository to build the GUI component of the site UD1Links to an external site.
Create your group for this UD here on Canvas and ensure all group members are added. If you are solo, then create a group and only add yourself.
Download your diagram (as an image or PDF) and upload below. Make sure to include it in your README.md file in your as well!
Submitting your Unit 2 Deliverable project/code
on GitHub, one submission per group by making a group for the UD2 project. You all can collaborate on there very easily!
using IntelliJ, you can collaborate using the "Code With Me" feature. One submission per group by having one member compress (ZIP) the project folder and uploading it below 
on Canvas submit a link to the repository and the picture of the GUI
lastly commit and push your code to the repository on GithubLinks to an external site.
Note: if working in a team of 2 or 3, only one of you needs to submit. However, make sure that your partners are added to the group! If you are working solo, you don't need to add anyone to your group just submit normally.
